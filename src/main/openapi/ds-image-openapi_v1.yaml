    This API implements the functionality of the IIPImage API into the OpenAPI framework used at KB.
    
    The goal is to implement key functionalities from [IIPImage](https://iipimage.sourceforge.io/documentation/protocol/). The following API's are implemented here:
    - [IIIF API](https://iiif.io/api/image/3.0/)
    - [Internet Imaging Protocol](https://iipimage.sourceforge.io/IIPv105.pdf)
    - Deepzoom

    The IIIF Framework is the cornerstone of the services used at The Royal Danish Library.
    Internally IIP and Deepzoom are only used in specific cases. We recommend using IIIF when possible.    

    Specification for OpenAPI can be found [here](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/).

          description: |- 
            The region parameter defines the rectangular portion of the underlying image content to be returned
            
            Region can be specified by pixel coordinates, percentage or by the value full, which specifies that the full image should be returned.
            
            | Form | Description |
            |------|-------------|
            |**full**|The full image is returned, without any cropping.|
            |**square**|The region is defined as an area where the width and height are both equal to the length of the shorter dimension of the full image. The region may be positioned anywhere in the longer dimension of the full image at the server’s discretion, and centered is often a reasonable default.|
            |**x,y,w,h**|The region of the full image to be returned is specified in terms of absolute pixel values. The value of x represents the number of pixels from the 0 position on the horizontal axis. The value of y represents the number of pixels from the 0 position on the vertical axis. Thus the x,y position 0,0 is the upper left-most pixel of the image. w represents the width of the region and h represents the height of the region in pixels.|
            |**pct:x,y,w,h**|The region to be returned is specified as a sequence of percentages of the full image’s dimensions, as reported in the image information document. Thus, x represents the number of pixels from the 0 position on the horizontal axis, calculated as a percentage of the reported width. w represents the width of the region, also calculated as a percentage of the reported width. The same applies to y and h respectively.|

          in: path
          description: |- 
            The size parameter specifies the dimensions to which the extracted region, which might be the full image, is to be scaled. With the exception of the w,h and ^w,h forms, the returned image maintains the aspect ratio of the extracted region as closely as possible. 
            
            Sizes prefixed with ^ allow upscaling of the extracted region when its pixel dimensions are less than the pixel dimensions of the scaled region.
            
            | Form | Description |
            |------|-------------|
            |**max** |  The extracted region is returned at the maximum size available, but will not be upscaled. The resulting image will have the pixel dimensions of the extracted region, unless it is constrained to a smaller size by maxWidth, maxHeight, or maxArea as defined in the Technical Properties section.|
            |**^max**|  The extracted region is scaled to the maximum size permitted by maxWidth, maxHeight, or maxArea as defined in the Technical Properties section. If the resulting dimensions are greater than the pixel width and height of the extracted region, the extracted region is upscaled.|
            |**w,**|  The extracted region should be scaled so that the width of the returned image is exactly equal to w. The value of w must not be greater than the width of the extracted region.|
            |**^w,**|  The extracted region should be scaled so that the width of the returned image is exactly equal to w. If w is greater than the pixel width of the extracted region, the extracted region is upscaled.|
            |**,h**|  The extracted region should be scaled so that the height of the returned image is exactly equal to h. The value of h must not be greater than the height of the extracted region.|
            |**^,h**|  The extracted region should be scaled so that the height of the returned image is exactly equal to h. If h is greater than the pixel height of the extracted region, the extracted region is upscaled.|
            |**pct:n**|  The width and height of the returned image is scaled to n percent of the width and height of the extracted region. The value of n must not be greater than 100.|
            |**^pct:n**|  The width and height of the returned image is scaled to n percent of the width and height of the extracted region. For values of n greater than 100, the extracted region is upscaled.|
            |**w,h**|  The width and height of the returned image are exactly w and h. The aspect ratio of the returned image may be significantly different than the extracted region, resulting in a distorted image. The values of w and h must not be greater than the corresponding pixel dimensions of the extracted region.|
            |**^w,h**|  The width and height of the returned image are exactly w and h. The aspect ratio of the returned image may be significantly different than the extracted region, resulting in a distorted image. If w and/or h are greater than the corresponding pixel dimensions of the extracted region, the extracted region is upscaled.|
            |**!w,h**|  The extracted region is scaled so that the width and height of the returned image are not greater than w and h, while maintaining the aspect ratio. The returned image must be as large as possible but not larger than the extracted region, w or h, or server-imposed limits.|
            |**^!w,h**|  The extracted region is scaled so that the width and height of the returned image are not greater than w and h, while maintaining the aspect ratio. The returned image must be as large as possible but not larger than w, h, or server-imposed limits.|

        - name: rotation
          in: path
          description: |-
            The rotation parameter specifies mirroring and rotation. A leading exclamation mark (“!”) indicates that the image should be mirrored by reflection on the vertical axis before any rotation is applied.
            
            The numerical value represents the number of degrees of clockwise rotation, and may be any floating point number from 0 to 360.
            
            | Form | Description |
            |------|-------------|
            |**n**|The degrees of clockwise rotation from 0 up to 360.|
            |**!n**|The image should be mirrored and then rotated as above.|
            
            In most cases, rotation will change the width and height dimensions of the returned image. The service should return an image that contains all of the image contents requested in the region and size parameters, even if the dimensions of the returned image file are different than specified in the size parameter. The image contents should not be scaled as a result of the rotation, and there should be no additional space between the corners of the rotated image contents and the bounding box of the returned image.

            For rotations which are not multiples of 90 degrees, it is recommended that the client request the image in a format that supports transparency, such as png, and that the server return the image with a transparent background. There is no facility in the API for the client to request a particular background color or other fill pattern.

        - name: quality
          in: path
          description: |-
            The quality parameter determines whether the image is delivered in color, grayscale or black and white.
            
            `default` (IIIF 3.0) and `native` (IIIF 1.0) has the same effect.
            
            | Form | Description |
            |------|-------------|
            |**color**|  The image is returned with all of its color information.|
            |**gray**|  The image is returned in grayscale, where each pixel is black, white or any shade of gray in between.|
            |**bitonal**|  The image returned is bitonal, where each pixel is either black or white.|
            |**default**|  The image is returned using the server’s default quality (e.g. color, gray or bitonal) for the image.|
            |**native**|  The image is returned using the server’s default quality (e.g. color, gray or bitonal) for the image.|
            
            The default quality exists to support [level 0 compliant implementations](https://iiif.io/api/image/3.0/compliance/#quality) that may not know the qualities of individual images in their collections. It also provides a convenience for clients that know the values for all other parameters of a request except the quality (e.g. .../full/120,80/90/{quality}.png to request a thumbnail) in that a preliminary image information request that would only serve to find out which qualities are available can be avoided.

        DeepZoom is deprecated. Internally it is used for one specific service, which is to be handled differently in the future.  

        DeepZoom is almost always used with the OpenSeadragon software. OpenSeadragon is capable of using IIIF directly through IIIF's *myimage/info.json*. 

        DeepZoom provides the ability to interactively view high-resolution images. You can zoom in and out of images rapidly without affecting the performance of your application. Deep Zoom enables smooth loading and panning by serving up multi-resolution images and using spring animations.

      description: |- 
        Color twist / channel recombination. Recombine the available image channels into a new color image by multiplication through a matrix. Columns are separated by commas and rows are separated by semi-colons. Values can also be negative.
        
        Thus, for the 3×3 matrix example provided below, the RGB output image will have bands R = R*r1 + G*g1 + B*b1, G = R*r2 + G*g2 + B*b2, B = R*r3 + G*g3 + B*b3.
        
        For multi-band images, the row length should correspond to the number of available bands within the image. The number of output bands depends on the number of rows in the matrix. Thus, to output a 1 band greyscale image, specify just a single row.

        Examples:
        To perform naive conversion from 3 channel color to 1 channel grayscale: CTW=[0.33,0.33,0.33]
        
        To flip the R and B channels and map an RGB image to BGR: CTW=[0,0,1;0,1,0;1,0,0]
        
        For a 5-band multispectral image, to show the difference between the 5th and 2nd band (i.e. 5th-2nd) and outputting the result as grayscale: CTW=[0,-1,0,0,1]
        
        To create a false-color image from a 4-band RGB-IR image by mapping the G,R,IR channels to the output RGB: CTW=[0,1,0,0;0,0,1,0;0,0,0,1]
        
        **CTW has to be defined as [array;array;array] using ; as delimter between arrays and , between integers**
